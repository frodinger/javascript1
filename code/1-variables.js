A const is a variable which cannot be re-assigned. Below you have a `const`
variable called `fruit` which is assigned the value "Apple".

Your task is to re-assign the `fruit` variable to "Orange" by re-assigning
the fruit variable a new value (so first it should be set to "Apple", and
then on another line, it should be assigned "Orange").
